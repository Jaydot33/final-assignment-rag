# Final Assignment: Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository contains my final assignment for advanced NLP coursework (Coursera/IBM). The notebook demonstrates building a Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combining Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), FAISS, and large language models for advanced document question answering.

## Key Features
- Dense Passage Retriever (DPR) for semantic retrieval
- FAISS for fast vector similarity search
- Integration with seq2seq/LLM (e.g., GPT2)
- End-to-end QA system on real policy/knowledge data
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with all code, results, and annotations

## Skills Showcased
- RAG architectures, semantic retrieval, LLM generation
- Hugging Face, FAISS, PyTorch
- Searching and answering from knowledge bases/documents
